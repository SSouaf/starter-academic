abstract: Alloy is both a formal language and a tool for software modeling. The language is basically first order relational logic. The analyzer is based on instance finding: it tries to refute assertions and if it succeeds it reports a counterexample. It works by translating Alloy models and instance finding into SAT problems. If no instance is found it does not mean the assertion is satisfied. Alloy relies on the small scope hypothesis: examining all small cases is likely to produce interesting counterexamples. This is very valuable when developing a system. However, Alloy cannot show their absence. In this paper, we propose an approach where Alloy can be used as a first step, and then using a tool we develop, Alloy models can be translated to Coq code to be proved correct interactively.
